## Mission Statement

Modern life overwhelms us with choices. Five coffee shops on the way in to work.
Hundreds of television stations. Thousands of movies available to stream at our slightest whim.
This choice can paralyze even the brightest, keenest minds of our generation.

Introducing OK Kyle, the revolutionary new app that frees you from the tyranny of choice.
Meet Kyle, a charming redhead from quaint Lancaster county. Swipe left, swipe right, all
you get is Kyle. No longer will your dating app inundate you with options, as soon as you
download the app, you have made your choice.

Fear not though advocates of options, you have near infinite Kyles at your disposal.
Prefer a sportier man? There's a Kyle for that. Want a guy that can cook you an amazing meal?
There's a Kyle for that. Even though he's just one man, his range will surprise and
delight you.

We here at OK Kyle know that there will be a Kyle for you. Time to visit the
site and start swiping!

## Technologies
* React Single Page Application

  Enjoy the lightening quick response time of a React application so that you can view
  more Kyles in less time. As you swipe, there are no page reloads, only blissful Fetch calls
	to make your swiping life easier and quicker.

	The app follows a container, component architecture pattern to make editing the code easier
	as well for all who wish to contribute to the project.

* Ruby on Rails API Back-end with ActiveModel Serializer

  Built on the powerful and reliable Rails framework, OK Kyle's growingly complex
  feature set will run efficiently and effectively for a stable user experience. 

	ActiveModel Serializer also makes editing and working with the API incredibly easy including
	the use of nested models within our JSON responses.

* ActionCable

	ActionCable runs Ok-Kyle's chat feature. Using this cutting edge web sockets technology
	you can interact with your Kyle instantly. As soon as you're matched, the application will
	create a chatroom for you and you can get talking!

	If you're a Kyle, not to worry, there is a handy (if incredibly simple) AI built in for you
	to autorespond with a "spicy" response when things are getting a little out of control.

* Full Custom Styling
	
	Kyle is a special man and he deserves his very own styling. Despite learning a good bit about
	CSS frameworks such as Foundation, we decided to implement the styling from scratch in this
	project to learn more about SASS and all it has to offer. While creating a unique product for
	Kyle, it also enabled us to experiment with media queries and understand far better what
	CSS frameworks are doing under the hood.

### Note
This application was initially created during Launch Academy's Ship It Saturday hackathon 
(this team's second)! During this time, we achieved an MVP with the swipe and match functionality
. After the event, we continued to iterate over many features and added a substantial amount of 
code to get the product to where we wanted!
